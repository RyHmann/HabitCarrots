# HabitCarrots : Build new babits with positive reinforcement
This is intended to be a web application used to build new habits by rewarding yourself.

## Intent
Building a new positive habit is one of the most difficult things you can undertake. I also love making web applications and learning about new architecture. This is the intersection of the two! Currently I'm using this as a project that will (hopefully) help me build new habits, and learn about 'Clean Arhchitecture / Onion Architecture' while building it! This architecture is pretty popular at the moment, but [Jason Taylor's project](https://github.com/jasontaylordev/CleanArchitecture) was my first exposure to it.

## Status
This application is very much in progress at the moment. Currently, we are in the stage of setting up the various projects and scaffolding up the foundational features.

## Future Plans
